# UAV Clustering for Enhanced Disaster Management in Dynamic Environments
 This repository is for the simulation in conjuction with the written thesis with the title above.

## Initial setup
 Setup the initial conditions in config.yml. Various factors that can be changed are listed below.
 1. Simulation cycle
 2. Size of map
 3. Algorithm applied
 4. Cluster node data generation
 5. Base station location
 6. UAV data initialization
 7. LEACH protocol

## Additional settings
 - Change mobility speed settings in mobility.yml
 - Change pathloss values in pathloss.yml

## How to run simulation
1. Download all required libraries.
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the main file
```
 python main.py
```
3. Example output
